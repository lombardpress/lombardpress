After a lot of work, I've finally been able to fully integrate IIIF images from distributed image services into the LombardPress web publication system. Now, at the touch of button you can quickly toggle images of diverse witnesses for each paragraph, served from different libraries throughout the world. Watch the demo and share.

The site is live at [http://plaoulcommentary.lombardpress.org](http://plaoulcommentary.lombardpress.org). However, I'm still testing, so you'll need an invite to view it. Just email me at jeffreycwitt [at] gmail [dot] com and I'll be happy to send you an invite. I would, of course, be grateful for any and all feedback.
