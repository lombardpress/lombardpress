I just added two new IIIF manifests for witnesses of *Sentences* commentaries to the SCTA Image Viewer made available through UPenn's [OPenn](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Collections.html) project and, of course, [IIIF](http://iiif.io).

First, there is codex 1147 which contains Book 3 of Lombard's Sentences commentary.
Visit [http://mirador.scta.info](http://mirador.scta.info) and search for "1147", "Lombard" or "Philadelphia" and you'll be sure to find it.

Now you can see this UPenn manuscript side by side a witness of the same text in the BnF, ms. lat. 15705.

Just paste these manifest links into any IIIF viewer and view the texts:

* http://scta.info/iiif/pl-penn1147/manifest
* http://scta.info/iiif/pl-bnf15705/manifest

I also added a manifest for an anonymous fragment of a *Sentences* commentary, UPenn codex 727, IIIF manifest: 

* http://scta.info/iiif/anon1-penn727/manifest

On my count, these are the 38 and 39th witnesses in the viewer. Woohoo!!!
