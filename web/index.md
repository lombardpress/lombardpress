# About LombardPress Web

The LombardPress web publication framework is designed as a reading interface where a user can read and explore digital critical editions. It provides a place for user accounts, comments, permissions, manuscript facsimile viewing, on demand collation and many other features.

The web publication framework can be used to display an critical text. The framework itself relies on external services to retrieve texts (the SCTA api) and images (the IIIF api).

It's currently in private alpha testing, and we hope to move it to public beta testing in the Fall of 2016. The alpa, in development site, can be viewed at [http://scta.lombardpress.org](http://scta.lombardpress.org)

Below are some screen shots of the reading environment
