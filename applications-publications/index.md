# LombardPress Schema

The LombardPress Schema is a narrow customization of the more general TEI specification. This customization allows us to document and encode the increasingly complex interaction of works, transcriptions, translations, and images that constitute the corpus of scholastic texts. For more, see [Lbp Schema](/schema/docs/index)

# LombardPress Web Publication Framework

The *LombardPress-Web*  is a web application designed to allow users to read and study digitally encoded texts, particularly those edited according to the LombardPress Schema and ingested in the [Scholastic Commentaries and Text Archive](http://scta.info). For more see [Lbp Web](/web)

# LombardPress Print

*LombardPress Print* is a set of stylesheets, scripts, and workflows designed to allow for the easy typesetting of complexly encoded critical editions in LaTeX and ultimately the transformation of these texts into camera ready proofs. For more see [Lbp Print](/print)

# Pellego

*Pellego* is a simple text viewer, designed to consume the SCTA simple presentation API. Pellego can function as a standalone app or easily embedded within in any website.
