# Linked Data and the Medieval Scholastic Tradition

Dates: August 17-19, 2016
Location: Basel, Switzerland
Sponsored by: The University of Basel

## Abstract 

This workshop aims to bring together stake holders from a variety of projects in an effort to chart the course for the future development of scholastic corpora in the digital age. As a group, we plan to discuss how we can merge the increasing number of disparate datasets into a connected whole. This includes the linking of manuscript metadata, manuscript facsimiles, digital transcriptions, translations, commentaries, and secondary literature. Central topics of discussion will include consideration of the data models and technologies required to build this connected corpus, as well as how to incorporate the large amounts of textual data currently being produced by textual editors.
