    # I.A. The Basic Problem
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Today, traditional mechanisms of publishing scholarly editions of medieval
    scholastic texts are no longer helping to advance scientific research.

    Instead, considered in light of what is now possible,
    traditional publishing workflows are preventing progress.

    These workflows are preventing collaborative aggregation,
    computer assisted analysis and discovery,
    open access, and data re-use.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    When it is easier to access the manuscripts or early printed editions
    of Gregory of Rimini’s Lectura than the modern critical edition,
    it is clear that publication is failing in its fundamental task of making data
    **publically** available for research.

  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    What is more, the fragmentation of these editions with different publishers,
    who prepare data according to proprietary and incompatible data
    standards, means first that the creation of an edition requires wasteful
    redundancies. Second it means that the aggregation and analysis of connected
    content is impossible.

      A quick glance around the internet at research groups attempting to create a web presence
      for scholastic texts reveals that the paradigm of isolation and redundancy
      is alive and well on the web.

  <section data-markdown>
    The result of this approach,
    when speaking either of printed books or webpages,
    is a world of data silos

  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    **In sum**: research groups are currently
    choosing the most inefficient way possible
    to make data available on the web,
    while leaving us with results that go barely
    beyond the capabilities of the printed page.

    # II.B Why This Problem Exists
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>The problem lies in our understanding of the heart of what an edition is.</p>

    # II.C Why This Problem Should No Longer Exist
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Today, we have mechanisms of recording the semantic meaning of a text
    and the relationships between texts
    that are not tied to any particular presentational form.

    ![xml](/assets/images/porto-slides/diplomatic-transcr-example.png)

    We should be using these tools.

    # II.D Why This Problem Persists In Web Form
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    The problem with simple webpage publication is clear from the name.

    It encourages us to continue to think about our texts
    as “pages” confined to the page.

    Such pages are only usable to us as already presented pages,
    and not as re-usable data.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    A shift to a "text-as-network" paradigm will let us see our editions
    first and foremost as data structures that can easily
    be connected to other networks or manipulated into any form of presentation.

    # II.E	Why This Problem Is So Important To Solve
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    The medieval scholastic corpus is a vast internconnected tapestry.

    The problem is that the current publication paradigm makes it impossible
    for us to see this tapestry.

    No individual reader will ever be able to
    read the entire corpus or discover all the connections within it.

    If we are ever to achieve the goal of seeing the entire tapestry,
    we must find a collaborative solution
    that allows the small contributions of individual editors
    to be aggregated over time into an organized
    and navigable network.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    The Good News: We are already on are way to solving it
    and we need your participation.

      # II.F	The Aim of the SCTA
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
      First: to form a community of people who develop and maintain editorial
      guidelines and best practices for the semantic markup of a text
      and the ontologies that organize these texts.
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
      Second: to aggregate and organize this text data so that
      it can be offered back to the entire community as service
      that can be used and re-used for traditional and untraditional purposes.
