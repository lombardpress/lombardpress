		<h2>Transcription Data: The Importance of Creating Great, Reusable, Data</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>All transcription is data creation</p>

		<p>But not all data is equal</p>

		<p>Some data is messy, ambiguous, and unclear</p>

		<p>Some data is well formed, well structured, and unambiguous</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>All data creation involves the identification of data types.</p>

		<p>Declaring data types is what we mean when we say we are "encoding" a text.</p>

		<p>But there are different ways of encoding a text, and each method has pros and cons</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>Two most common types of encoding for textual editors</p>
		
		<p>Visual Encoding vs. Semantic Encoding</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Visual Encoding (VE)<h4>
		<ul>
			<li>VE is what most traditional editors are use to</li>
			<li>VE declares data types through visual differentiation</li>
			<li>A title is differentiated from a regular text through italic rendering</li>
			<li>A paragraph usually begins with an indentation represented through extra white space at the beginning of a line</li>
			<li>A header is usually centered on the page, slighly larger, and surrounded by extra white space.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Example of Visual Encoding</h2>

	<section>
		<h2>The cons of visual encoding</h2>
		<p>While visual encoding may initially seem more intuitive and more pleasing to an editor, it has TWO fundamental problems.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>First Problem: It is consistentally ambiguous about the identification of datatypes</h4>
		<p>For example consider the various uses of italic rendering in a critical editions</p>
		<img src="/assets/images/print-text-example.png">
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Second Problem: It fuses form and matter, making data type recognition inseparable from its original material representation</h4>

		<p>If a heading is identified by its position in the center of a page surrounded by whitespace, if this rendering were lost, its distinction from the surrounding text would be lost.</p>

		<p>This makes the dream of creating multiple representations (such as print and web displays) from a Single Source Document impossible.</p>

		<p>Our aim must be to de-couple form and matter so that we can take that content and instantiate it in as many different types of matter (or media) as we wish.
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Semantic Encoding (SE)</h4>
		<p>The better alternative is semantic encoding.</p>

		<p>Instead of distinguish data types by how they appear, we explicit label data types using an agreed upon field standard vocabulary</p>

		<p>If the data is a heading then let's call it a heading.</p>

		<p>If the data is a title let's call it a title</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Simple Example of Semantic Encoding</h4>
		
		<div class="xml-block">
			<span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span>Paragraph about 
			<span class="element">&lt;name&gt;</span>Augustine<span class="element">&lt;/name&gt;</span> and his work <span class="element">&lt;title&gt;</span>City of God<span class="element">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
			<span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
		</div>

	<section><h2>Corpus Data: A data model to organize and relate all this transcription data</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>Consider the enormous variation data required to comprehensively describe a critical text</p>

		<p>For example</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The whole text</li>
			<li>Main subdivisions</li>
			<li>Witnesses to the text and its parts</li>
			<li>Transcriptions of individual witnesses</li>
			<li>Transcriptions of critical text build from transcriptions of individual witnesses</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Such a list only scratches the surface</p>

		<h2>Image Data: A data model to manage digital images of manuscripts</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>In order to create views where text and images can be immediately called upon and compared, a significant amount of abstraction and data-modelings is necessary.</p>
		<p>We need to keep track of single digital files and their relationship to a "folio" or "page".</p>
		<p>Further keep track of that folios place within the "material hierarchy" (the codex) and the "content hierarchy" (the text).</p>
		<p>Finally, we need to be able to track connections between our transcriptions of the text, folios, and by extention the digitial images to which those transcriptions are related</p>

	<section>
		<h3>The "text" has several "witnesses" or "manifestations"</h3>

	<section>
		<h4>Each of these "manifestations" has folios, which are digitial represented by at least one digital image, but sometimes several</h4>
