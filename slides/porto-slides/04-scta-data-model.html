      What I'd like to do this afternoon is talk about how we can organize all these transcriptions, so that can be automatically used by applications to produce both web reading applications and print renderings. 

      But this gets really complicated really fast. 

      So what I'd like to do is come at this from the most concrete point of view possible. That is, from the point of view of what data do I need to create and how do I need to encode it so that it can be used by this data model. 

      I introduced this briefly yesterday with the idea of "Corpus Data". Today I want to discuss this in a bit more depth.

      Then once you have a little sense of the kind of data we need to create, we can step back and talk about what happens to that data and how applications use ti.

	<h2>The Projectdata file</h2>

	<p>The basic task we are undertaking here is the traditional task of building a table of contents.</p>

	<p>But this table contents is also going to determine the ids and relationships between resources in our datamodel</p>

	<p>It also going to provide with guidance as to how we structure files and directories</p>

	<p>While immediate purpose of doing things this way may not seem immediately obvious, just keep the following rule of in mind.</p>

	<p>Strong organization enables automation.</p>

	<p>Sample projectdata files:</p>
	<p style="font-size: 80%">Tip: you can load any of these files into Oxygen and play around with them by simply coping the url, selecting open url from the file menu, and pasting the url into the provided field.</p>

		<h2>Looking at the projectdata file</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>A word of caution</h2>
		<p>It is important to simply reiterate that the standardization of the projectdata file is still a work in progress.</p>

		<p>As our community grows, its logic and standardization will improve</p>

		<p>For the moment, this means we simply need to build the file in the same way I have done so that the automatic scripts will still work, even if this is not always the best way.</p>

		<p>What's exciting about the prospect of working together, is that as we had more data, we discover more flaws or bugs in the system and logic, and then improve it together.</p>

	<h2>The Header</h2>

	<p>The header is not something you need to be too worried about. It's simple function is to collect metadata about this text, the helps us link its parent work group, to its author, the varous witness to this text.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h2> Div@id=body </h2>

	<p>This is simply the body tag that will contain your table of contents. (In the future, this mostly likely be changed to simpley &lt;body&gt;.)</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h2>Items</h2>

	<p>Within this body tag, there are two many division you can make: Items and Divisions. 

	<p>Items are the privileged divisions in your text. In the case of the Peter of Spain example, these seem to be Tractatus 1, Tractatus 2, etc etc.</p>

	<p>Items will correspond to the file divisions of your text. We expect there to be a separate file for each section of the text that is identified as an item. If your text is very small, its possible that you will only have one Item. But in very large texts, it is extremely helpful to be able to break the text up into multiple files.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h2>Divisions</h2>

	<p>Even though Items are privileged sections, it is also quite possible that these sections should be grouped in larger divisions.</p>

	<p>This is very common in Sentences Commentaries, where questions are grouped within distinction divisions, and distinction divisions are grouped with book divisions.</p>

	</section>
	<section>
	<h2>hasWitnesses->witness->folio</h2>
	<p>The hasWitnesses section is designed to tell us whether or not a particular Item appears in a particular manuscript. The folio references go further to tell us what folios this section of the text falls on.</p>

	<p>It is this data that allows us to build table of contents for each manuscript as well as for the text as a whole</p>
