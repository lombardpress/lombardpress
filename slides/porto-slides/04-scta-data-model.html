        What I'd like to do this afternoon is talk about how we can organize all these trancriptions, so that can be automatically used by applications to produce both web reading applications and print renderings. 

        But this gets really complicated really fast. 

        So what I'd like to do is come at this from the most concrete point of view possible. That is, from the point of view of what data do I need to create and how do I need to encode it so that it can be used by this data model. 

        I introduced this briefly yesterday with the idea of "Corpus Data". Today I want to discuss this in a bit more depth.

        Then once you have a little sense of the kind of data we need to create, we can step back and talk about what happens to that data and how applications use ti.

When this information is place, we can use it to construct a special of kind of database that is REALLY good and making links between resources.

<section data-markdown>
We can visualize what this data looks like at scta.info. Spend some time playing around with this.

how this information gets used in a consuming application. Include screen shots of lbp / use live demo if possible.</section>
<section>
This same demo is what allows to manipulate our transcription data in all kinds of ways for MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS. A great example of this is how can use this information to enrich our experience of a manuscript in a IIIF viewer called Mirador. 

Examples of Structural, Search, and Transcription Data. (TODO: need to get texts.scta.info working with new lbp.rb and scta.schema.)

Go back to project file. Discuss how we need to create one for each of your texts, so that database knows about this resource.
