<h2>The primary responsibility for editors is to connect manuscript and witness information to IIIF canvasid</h2>

<p>Every published IIIF manifest mints a set unique ID for the "canvas" of a manuscript page.</p>

<p>By linking our folio markers to these canvas ids, we ensure that we can access the images for these folios anywhere in the world on any server and we ensure that our transcription and commentary can be linked back to these images</p>

</section>

<h2>What does this mean in practice?</h2>

<p>Currently, TEI has no clear standards for embedding IIIF canvas ids into TEI documents</p>

<p>But this is not a difficult task. We just need to agree on the way to do it, and we are working on this.</p>

<p>For now, we have temporary ways of including this information</p>
